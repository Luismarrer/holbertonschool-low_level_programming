C - More malloc, free

This directory contains the second project on advanced memory management using the malloc and
free functions as part of the Holberton School curriculum. Building on the foundations of our
first malloc project, this continuation aims to further enhance our skills in dynamic memory
allocation by diving deeper into manual memory management in C programming. With this project,
we address more complex challenges and create our own functions that manipulate memory without
relying on automatic memory management or helper functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc,
etc.
